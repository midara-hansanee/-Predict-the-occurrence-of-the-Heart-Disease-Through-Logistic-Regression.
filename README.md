 Predict the occurrence of the Heart Disease,
       Through Logistic Regression.

### ❤️ Predicting Heart Disease with Logistic Regression

Heart disease is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. **Early detection** is crucial for effective prevention and management. One effective method is **logistic regression** — a widely used statistical technique in predictive modeling to estimate the probability of a binary outcome.

This summary explores:

- The fundamentals of **logistic regression**
- Its application in **heart disease prediction models**
- Key **risk factors** influencing heart disease
- The importance of **predictive modeling** in improving healthcare outcomes

By leveraging logistic regression, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions and proactively address heart disease risks.

Dataset

Originally sourced from the UCL Machine Learning Repository, the dataset used to
predict heart disease is currently hosted on the "data. World" platform.
